# CCJSProjects
A collection of the various JavaScript projects that I completed via the respective Codecademy course.

Project descriptions:
  Address Book: A program that allows you to search through and add to a contacts list.
  Cash Register: A program that simulates a cash register, allowing you to add items with set prices, create employees with specified discount amounts, void transactions, and calculate the total cost of all items in a shopping trip.
